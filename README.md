# Personal Finance CLI APP

This is a simple CLI app i made following a tutorial on youtube it uses the pandas Module for data storing and manipulation to a CSV file format.

## Requirements and run

Install the matplotlib module and the pandas module

    pip install matplotlib
    pip install pandas

To run:

    python main.py

## Features

- Add transaction - add a Income or Expense Transaction
  
- View transaction and a summary - Lists all transaction in a given date range and gives a summary containing Income, Expense and Net-Savings

## Bugs and future ideas

Ideas: 

- For now i want to add a remove transaction option

Bugs: 

- Currently the app has a bug with the plot maker and it just breaks and doesn't show the plot correctly
